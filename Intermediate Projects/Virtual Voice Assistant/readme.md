# Virtual Voice Assistant

## Project Description
### What it does
This virtual voice assistant currently can only do 5 basic things:
  1. Greet
  2. Respond to how are you
  3. Tell the time
  4. Do a wiki search
  5. Change languages
  
### What technologies were used
The script for this assistant was made in python but I also included external libraries and modules such as:
  1. SpeechRecognition
  2. Wikipedia
  3. Google Text to Speech (gTTS)
  4. PyAudio
  5. Playsound
  
### Challenges in making this
Creating the respond and listen functions were fairly easy.
The hard part was implementing the wiki search and language changing features, as those tend to break and raise certain errors I didn't expect / know about.

### What's the plan now?
In the future I hope to give this virtual voice assistant more features and hopefully a GUI or a 2D model.

## How to Use
If you would like to try this script out you can simply copy and paste the code from assistant.py, just make sure you have a venv ready with the dependencies.
