# My Python Projects
This is a repository for all projects that I have made in the past few months, completely built on python.

## Why Python?
I chose to showcase my projects made in python because I have been learning python for quite a while now and would finally like to take in some feedback from the coding community on my knowledge.

## What projects are in here?
The projects showcased here are mostly beginner to intermediate levels and a more detail description of each project will be available in each project's readme file.
In the future I hope to fill this repository with more advanced projects, including data science or machine learning projects.
