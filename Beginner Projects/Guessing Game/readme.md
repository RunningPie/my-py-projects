# Number Guessing Game

## Project Description
So as you can guess from the title, this project (or script) is basically a number guessing game you can play on a terminal
To be honest, when I first made this I imported the wrong library for randint, causing reference error.
For now this seems kind of basic, but I hope I can implement a GUI for it in the future

## How to use
If you would like to try this game out, you can simply fork this repo or copy paste the code to your local IDE
